## Objective
Creating threads that represent different banking 

## Challenges and Solutions

#### Challenge 1:
Settig up the Virtual Machine brought up some issues as it had been a while since I had set one up. My machine did nto have a lot of space which I did not realize initially so it kept breaking.

#### Solution:
I freed up some space and it eventually started working. I allocated about 3000MB of memory as well us 3 processors which worked fine

#### Challenge 2:
Though not mandatory, I initially tried coding directly in C in gedit which was not the best idea as I barely had any experience with it

#### Solution:
I decided to code in Python as it was more familiar with me when it came to setting up Oriented Programming Programming and other concepts and use documentationa nd Artificial Intelligence to help me correct syntax and implement my code in C


## Outcomes:
- I was able to successfully set up a simulation of accounts processing transactions
- The transactions were running simultaneously and would even some times clash during run time. I had print statements printing on the same line
- I also able to increase my understanding of threads and familiarity with C
